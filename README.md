# Smart_Room_Environment_Control_System_Based_on_IoT
This IoT-based smart environment control system uses ESP8266 and a DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity. It automatically adjusts lamp brightness using a dimmer and activates two relays based on temperature thresholds. All data is monitored via the Blynk app.
