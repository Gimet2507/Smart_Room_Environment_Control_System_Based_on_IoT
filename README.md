# üåø Smart Room Environment Control System Based on IoT

This project implements a smart system to monitor and control the room environment using an IoT-based approach. The system utilizes the **ESP8266 NodeMCU** microcontroller combined with a **DHT22 sensor** to measure temperature and humidity in real-time. Based on the measured temperature, the system automatically adjusts:

- **AC Lamp Brightness** using a dimmer module
- **Relay Outputs** to control additional devices

All data and device status are visualized and controlled via the **Blynk IoT application**, enabling remote monitoring from anywhere.

## üîß Features

- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Automatic lamp dimming based on temperature thresholds
- Dual relay control for fan, cooler, or other appliances
- Integration with Blynk IoT for cloud monitoring and control
- Serial Monitor output for local debugging

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- If **temperature < 30¬∞C**:
  - Lamp is set to **100% brightness**
  - Relays are **OFF**
- If **30¬∞C ‚â§ temperature < 33¬∞C**:
  - Lamp is set to **50% brightness**
  - Relays are **OFF**
- If **temperature ‚â• 33¬∞C**:
  - Lamp is **OFF**
  - Relays are **ON** (e.g., to trigger ventilation or alarms)

## üì° Technologies Used

- **ESP8266 NodeMCU** for WiFi and control logic
- **DHT22** sensor for temperature and humidity readings
- **RBDdimmer** library to control lamp brightness
- **Blynk** platform for cloud dashboard and virtual pins
